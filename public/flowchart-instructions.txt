<!-- 
IMPORTANT: Add your flowchart image here!
Place the flowchart image from your Canva project as:
public/flowchart.png

The image should be:
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Recommended size: 1200x600px or similar
- High quality for clear display on the landing page

If you don't have the image yet, you can:
1. Create a placeholder image
2. Use the one from your Canva project shown in the screenshot
3. The app will still work, but the hero section may not display the flowchart

The flowchart is referenced in:
- app/components/Hero.jsx (line with: src="/flowchart.png")
-->

This is a placeholder file. Replace it with your actual flowchart image.
